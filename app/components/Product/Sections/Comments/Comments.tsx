          description='Just did a solid week gouging and welding wearing this mask at
            Groote Eylandt mine in the NT, 38 degrees and very humid pretty much
            every day, not only is the ADFLO good for the lungs, itâ€™s also much
            cooler and less sweaty wearing this mask compared to a non air fed
            mask, should have bought one years ago. Andrew is also a top bloke,
            I phoned him on a Saturday to ask a few questions before ordering
            and he was more than helpful and got it out the door quickly to me,
            arriving in Darwin just over a week from ordering it, will be
            recommending him to lots of other boilermakers. Cheers mate.'

          description={`I'm sorry I didn't buy this helmet years ago! It's easy and conformable to wear once on you hardly notice it the back pack, the safety glass is very clear and good wide vision. Feel good on way home after work,  no red face. I don't get  dirty and breathing clean air makes a big difference, don't get tired any more. Long life battery. Good for all types of welding.  I've been wearing this helmet for many weeks now and  found no down side to this product , it should be compulsory for the industry. `}
